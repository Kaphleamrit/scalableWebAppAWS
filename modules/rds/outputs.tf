 It seems the response was cut off. Let me complete the RDS module for you.

### 5. RDS Module (continued)

**Directory:** `modules/rds`

**`outputs.tf`:**
```hcl
output "db_instance_endpoint" {
  description = "The connection endpoint for the RDS instance"
  value       = aws_db_instance.this.endpoint
}

output "db_instance_identifier" {
  description = "The RDS instance identifier"
  value       = aws_db_instance.this.id
}
